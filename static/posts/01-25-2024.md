I’m starting to lose motivation at work pretty badly. I’m finished with all of the house projects now, including the refinance, and I have enough liquid cash to live off for 6 months at the very least. Now that I’ve been working at this company for 2 years the pace of learning has dropped and I don’t think the job is worth my time. At this point I’m pretty confident if I go all in then I can build and sell things to support myself. I am potentially considering getting a sales-adjacent job so I can learn that skillset before I dive in, but I’m not totally convinced that is a better use of my time than just diving in and starting to build and sell and learning as I go. Either way, I’m getting that feeling that it’s time to do something new.

We saw a sign for free puppies in Blue Ridge and stopped to take a look. They are very cute. I would like to get a friend for our dog but I think another puppy would be too much for us to handle right now.

I tried a bunch of connectors for setting up the power on my LED boards but apparently the connector type these boards use is not standard and very hard to find. So I’m just going to do now what I should have done at the beginning and solder wires directly to the pins. Apparently in electronics it is very common to strip wires and cut them then solder them to things. For some reason this does not seem like the right thing to do but apparently it is so I will be doing that.

Millan said that country music had its biggest year in 2023 since the 70s. I had no idea.

I’m looking back at [friendmail.co](https://friendmail.co/) and I love the landing page I built. It has a cute little logo and it is minimalistic and has a straightforward email signup. It could probably use some more description about exactly what the product is but this seems like a great starting point for future landing pages. I also built another website over the weekend and I think that design is pretty nice as well. If you’re interested send me a text and I’ll send the link.

Jake traded all of his players to Tommy in the fantasy basketball league. So there’s been collusion and cheating but Tommy is the commissioner so this is clearly a corrupt organization now. But I’m still winning and Tommy has not gained any ground so far and my team is still better than his. My question to Tommy and Jake…. you cheated and you still won’t win? Quite embarrassing.

I’ve canceled my subscription to [nobells.com](nobells.com) because I was told that if I paid $10/month then each month I would be able to request that the authors of the blog right a blurb about anything that I request. But I only got one blurb and I have been a loyal subscriber for at least 6 months.
