Last week was my first week at my new job of being unemployed. As my Daddima told me, “this job does not pay much.” But it was a busy, productive, stressful, eye-opening week. I have been working a lot and I had almost forgotten what it’s like to work all the time and feel good about it. I love building and learning things and that’s the reason I’m doing this so the last week was everything I could have hoped for. I mostly spent the last week on setting up online marketing. I have a budget of $3k per month to spend on the business. That feels like a lot for me but in the world of online advertising this is very small so I am trying to be extra conservative with my money and experiment a lot with a lot of different platforms and content. So far no more sales this past week which is disheartening but I’m confident as I keep experimenting I’ll find a formula that works and the sales will start to come in. My general framework is to use the month of March to focus on sales/marketing and the month of April to focus on building out the product into something that is completely finished and ready-to-ship.

Ilana’s parents got their family courtside seats at the Hawks game last night and her parents left at halftime so I got to join for the second half. They had a buffet of food and free drinks and _Lil Boosie_ and _Wiz Khalifa_ were there. We had fun even though the Hawks played one of their worst games of the season and they have lots of injured players.

I’m cleaning up my garage today and setting things up so that it looks really good for filming marketing content. The side effect is that it’s actually going to be a great place to hang out after I’m done, with some chairs and video games and the squat rack and decorations and colorful lights. I’ll send pics when it’s done.

Yesterday was daylight savings time and I had no idea it happened until about 3 hours after I woke up. The only reason I noticed is because I had my low-tech watch on and realized the time didn’t match up with my phone. If I had my Apple Watch on maybe I would have gone the whole day without realizing.

I asked Ilana again if I could get a gun for the house for defense and she said no :(
