My tent sauna came in the mail so it is all set up now and steamy steamy steamy. I haven’t taken a picture of it but the fence we set up was just barely big enough for it so when we walk in we have to squeeze through a small opening and you can only go right into the tent. I got a bluetooth air quality monitor to monitor the CO2, temperature, and humidity inside of it but because it is bluetooth (BLE specifically) the signal does not reach very far so I have ordered a small Raspberry Pi and I am going to set that up in range of the monitor and have that forward the data to a cloud server which will export the data and show it using open source graphing software called [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). That way I will be able to monitor the sauna from anywhere in the house which will give me more peace of mind to be able to leave it and do something else while it is heating up or cooling down.

We have lots of holiday events this week with family and friends so we are busy busy busy. The holidays are a fun time. My family does not like that I don’t ask for anything for Christmas or ask anyone what they want for Christmas but I feel that gifts are extra things and should be thoughtful.

There has been some trade action in the fantasy basketball league. Tommy has traded me Wembanyama for Porzingis. Very good trade for me, very poor trade for Tommy. Tommy keeps getting got every step of the way, and unfortunately for him his points total reflects that. Also unfortunately for everyone else in the league my team is far ahead in points and my team is all but decided as the clear winner. However, it makes me happy that they are having fun playing for second place.

Costco gold bars have made [the news](https://www.cnn.com/2023/12/16/business/costco-gold-bars/index.html) and now I am kicking myself for not buying one earlier because now all the bots and random mofos are gonna start trying to buy these when they come in stock and it’s gonna be like buying a PS5 when they first came out. I considered buying one a few months ago when it was in stock but decided not to because I am dumb.
