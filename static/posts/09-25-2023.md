I did not do much at all this week at work. When I think of something I want to build and then I start building it my energy gets totally consumed by that. I'm not good at having two things to focus on, but I usually can do one really well. Anyways, I got a soldering iron kit to weld some pieces together on my little computer chips but the iron I got was a super cheap one from China so it didn't work right. So I had to contort my hand in a weird way to get the heat on the metal and I accidentally touched my thumbnail to the iron and it burned it instantly. It was set to 400 degrees Celcius. I have a better soldering iron in the mail now so that this doesn't happen again. It was really lucky that my nail was long.

My new exercise thing officially is jump roping. The cardiovascular work required for jump roping apparently is about the same as running. And I don't have to go on a run to do it, I can just grab the jump rope and do it whenever and wherever. It is really hard but I'll keep slowlly getting better. I was able to do about 1 minute without tripping up this time last week and now I'm at 2. One day I'll do cool jump rope tricks.

I got this dumb wallet and key thing. Way too expensive and very hard to use. But my wallet and keyring are now insanely small so that's pretty cool.

I read a [great article](https://tynan.com/pinball) about pinball. The guy's whole blog is really great, he sells his own software and travels the world and does weird things. I looked on the [pinball map](https://pinballmap.com/) he links to and found a lot of places with pinball machines nearby. There's one in Acworth with 45 machines and one in Blue Ridge with 35 machines. Anyway apparently there is a lot that goes into pinball and Ilana and I are going to give it a try sometime this week hopefully.
