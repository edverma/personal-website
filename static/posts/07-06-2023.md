Ilana and I moved into the new house this past weekend. It was a busy weekend. I enjoyed it. Now we are all moved in and I am doing the same job and eating the same food and running the same errands and seeing my same friends and running my same runs. Just in a different place. Not much feels very different but the house is very nice and I am glad that I own it and live here.

The seller hired cleaners who left a big pile of trash in the yard. I bagged it all up while my neighbor and his friend sat on their porch and watched me.

Getting to the Beltline from my backyard is somewhat treacherous. It's not too bad, there's just lots of shrubbery and a steep slope to get there. I will make a path soon. When we were kids Tommy and I made a home inside of the bush in my parents' front yard. So I have experience.

Moving was a huge pain. It was nice to be busy and get rid of a lot of clutter but goddamn it's a pain.

I have decided to add some structure to my running. I want to keep running and the best motivation for me is to have a race to prepare for. I've decided to do one race per quarter, so four per year. I'm going to keep the distances somewhat short, between 5 and 10 kilometers. That way no matter how my training goes I will be able to at least finish the race. But hopefully I will be able to track my progress and see my race times get better and better throughout the years. I also am scheduling them with Ilana so that I can be sure she will be waiting for me when I finish. It's very nice to finish running and then spend time with her. If you are in Atlanta and want to come run with me or hang out afterwards let me know, the races are usually a pretty fun atmosphere. My next one is July 15 on the Westside Beltline, and the route goes right by my house.

Joe Rogan is getting pretty annoying to me now so I have not been listening very much. But the rapper Killer Mike came on the show and I like him a lot so I listened. They started talking about gambling and it got me excited. Gambling is amazing. I've been to Vegas twice and my favorite thing to do was bet on sports games. Watching games in Casino Sportsbooks was such a thrill. Anyways, I'm going to start gambling more to bring some more excitement into my day to day. I'll gamble on my tennis matches and race times. I'll play poker with whoever is game. And I've heard there is a Casino in Blue Ridge... I might need to see if they have a Sportsbook.

I installed a security system at the house. There are outdoor cameras on each side of the house and sensors on every door and window. The system uses wifi but has a cell service backup. This place is locked down. It's pretty nice being able to surveil all parts of my property. Anytime a car drives by or a critter is in my backyard or Ilana or I walk outside we can see what's going on. It makes us feel safer. However, what would make me feel even safer is owning a gun. Please send me your recommendations on which gun to buy and where I can get proper training. I'm not totally decided on if I will get one yet but it looks like I might do it. I want to be prepared for a worst case scenario type of thing where someone breaks into the house and is trying to kill us.
